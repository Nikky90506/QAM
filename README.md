Changes for future version 

* New feature: Auto All Items Are Craftable (however, only a few extra items such as serving tray can be fully used - you can craft locks, keys and 'spanking toys' but you need to pretend you have them and rp - also, don't forget that some items require the QAM unrestrict mode to be used)
* New feature: Auto Extra Buttons In Wardrobe: QAM Export and QAM Import for outfit + restraints (Note: the Export button can be used only when you come from a chat room - after clicking on this button, you must go back to the chat room and will find the code you can copy in a file and/or the clipboard)  
* New command: invisible2 to become invisible (glitter mask must be usable) - thanks to Lilly for her help
* New command: visible to go back to visible state after using of an invisible command
* Renamed kinkydungeon command as kd, updated and restructured it with modular cheats (cheat option has been replaced by 6 options: maxstats, moreitems, outfits, restraints, spells, weapons - use /help kd to know how to use the kd command)
* Added /help features with info about automatic features
* Renamed invisible command as invisible1 and improved it (effect will be seen by other players in all cases)
* Added QAM welcome message in main hall
* Added green background for most local messages and separate these messages from other messages in the chat
* Improved the nickname function (no message when you don't come from a chat room)
