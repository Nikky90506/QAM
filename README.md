Changes for future version 

* Improved the pose menu:
  - Auto Access to Pose Menu on Any Player
  - Auto General Availability of Pose Menu (no more limited to chat rooms and Photographic room)
  - Auto Priority to Pose Menu when you click on yourself
  - Added messages when pose menu used in a chat room
* Improved the pose2 command: No effect/message when no real change of a existing pose
* Renamed the release command as untie to avoid conflict with new BC command
* Added hovering text for export/import buttons in wardrobe
