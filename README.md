Changes for future version 

* New command: hear (hearingmode) to force a specific hearing mode. The mode is specified by a number between 0 and 4.
* New command: talk, which merges talkbaby and talkgag commands, and gives more options of gag talk sent to the server 
* Renamed the old gagtalk command as gagcode and improved it by using lillyBC gagspeak function (https://github.com/lillyBC/bcTampermonkeys):
  - works now also against deafness
  - in decoder mode, displays now both versions of the message
* Merged the gaglight and gagheavy commands into the new version of gagtalk command, used in a similar way to the talk command, but only for gag talk sent to the server 
* Fixed a bug in the unrestrict reset command
* Fixed a detail in the outfit command
